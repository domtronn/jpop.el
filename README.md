## Json Portrayal of Projects ##

**Jpop** is a lightweight _declarative_ project interaction
package for Emacs. It is designed to let users _define_ their
projects in json files in a similar fashion to _Sublime_ and
_Atom_. It allows you to group a few directories together as a
project so that your project can be composed of multiple
repositories/directories.

On top of this, it provides a nice set of features for interacting
with your projects including styling _(the ole' tabs vs spaces
debate)_, running/opening test files and the creation of
[ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/). It also gives you the ability
to quickly open directories _as a project_ and make all the files
within easily accessible.

It was built from a need for a particular data structure to describe a
project for use with my `JS-DEPENDENCY-INJECTOR` package for
require.js projects.

The mechanism for reading the operating system is a Python script for
efficiencies sake.

### Features ###

* Jump to a file within the project
* Toggle between code and its test file ( `main.js` <=> `mainSpec.js` )
* Reformat a file with proper tabs/spaces indentation levels
* Project specific styling/formatting
* Create throw-away project instances from directories
* Switch between buffers in a project
* Per Instance Caching of projects for quick switching
* Auto project switching when changing to project files

# Installation #

Clone this repository and add it to Emac's `load-path`. Then require
the file:

```
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/cloned/repo")
(require 'jpop)
```

Then enable it globally to load the key mappings

```
(jpop-global-mode)
```

# Defining a project #

This package *(currently only)* defines projects using JSON files.  It
defaults to looking in `jpop-project-directory` first.

If you load a *directory*, instead of a JSON file, it will just cache
all of the files recursively within that directory.

An example JSON project file would look like this:

```javascript
{
	"id":"My Project",
	"dirs":[
		{ "dir":"~/path/to/project", "create-tags": true},
		{ "dir":"~/path/to/another/project", "create-tags":false }
	],
	"libs":[
		{ "dir":"~/path/to/library", "create-tags": true, "id":"library-id"},
	],
	"style":{
		"tabs":false,
		"indent":2
	}
}
```

Where the `id` property and the the `dirs/dir` property define paths
required in that project. This is useful if you have multiple
respositories for a single project.

The `style` block, at the moment, defines how to indent the files
within the project.  The `tabs` property defines whether this projects
uses **tabs** or **spaces** and the `indent` property sets the tab
width/indent level of the project.

You can also override the use of `gitignore` on a project level, add a
`gitignore: true/false` property to the project file, and this will
take priority over the global variable.

# Usage #
If you enable `jpop-global-mode` you will have access to the following keybindings:

<kbd>C-x p k</kbd> | `jpop-kill-project-buffers` | Kill all of the buffers related to the current project

It is well worth looking through `customize-group RET jpop` to see what you can customise.


### Opening Tests ###

The `jpop-toggle-open-test` functions try and guess the
appropriate test for the current file you're in, however, if it fails
to find a test, it will run the hooks
`jpop-toggle-test-fallback-hook`.

As fallback behaviour you can have it _find test_ from your
project. Add the following snippet to your init file;

```elisp
(add-hook 'jpop-toggle-test-fallback-hook 'jpop-find-test)
```

### Caching ###

When switching between between projects using `jpop-change`,
`jpop` will _cache_ the results of the project you're changing
from. This is so that when/if you _change back_ to that project its
settings can be restored instantly without regenerating the file alist.

If the `jpop` file lists become stale, you can force a refresh
of the project with `jpop-refresh`.

### Auto Project Switching ###

When using caching, you can turn on auto project changing. When
switching between buffers, `jpop` will restore the cache of the
project containing that file. When switching to buffers that _are not
part of any_ project, you will remain in the project you are currently
in.

To enable/disable this, call
```
M-x jpop-enable-auto-change-projects
M-x jpop-disable-auto-change-projects
```

# Ctags and JavaScript #

Version 5.8 of Ctags doesn't really parse JavaScript correctly, and
won't work properly with things like `etags-select`.

To fix this, you can add a `.ctags` file in your `HOME` directory and
add the following matchers

```
--tag-relative=yes
--exclude=.git,.svn

--langdef=js
--langmap=js:.js
--regex-js=/([A-Za-z0-9._$]+)[ \t]*[:=][ \t]*\{/\1/,object/
--regex-js=/([A-Za-z0-9._$()]+)[ \t]*[:=][ \t]*function[ \t]*\(/\1/,function/
--regex-js=/function[ \t]+([A-Za-z0-9._$]+)[ \t]*\(([^)])\)/\1/,function/
--regex-js=/([A-Za-z0-9._$]+)[ \t]*[:=][ \t]*\[/\1/,array/
--regex-js=/([^= ]+)[ \t]*=[ \t]*[^"]'[^']*/\1/,string/
--regex-js=/([^= ]+)[ \t]*=[ \t]*[^']"[^"]*/\1/,string/

--langdef=coffee
--langmap=coffee:.coffee
--regex-coffee=/^[ \t]*([A-Za-z.]+)[ \t]+=.*->.*$/\1/f,function/
--regex-coffee=/^[ \t]*([A-Za-z.]+)[ \t]+=[^->\n]*$/\1/v,variable/
--regex-coffee=/^[ \t]*((class ){1}[A-Za-z.]+)[ \t]+=[^->\n]*$/\1/v,object/
```

Which will allow for proper JavaScript tags creation. You can also
copy `.ctags` from this project into your `HOME` directory.

#### Why not Projectile ####

I'm aware that [projectile](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile)
does a lot of this already and I would actively encourage you to try
that package out as well!

The _main reason_ I wrote my own version was that I work on projects
comprised of multiple directories that use
[RequireJS 0.15.0](https://libraries.io/bower/rjs/0.15.0) and I was
fed up of _manually_ typing the require paths for modules across
multiple projects. So I wrote my own _JS Dependency Injector_ which
uses an associative list of project ids _(the ones used in the require
js mapping definition)_ to a list of files with their containing
directories. This way I could build the require paths for Classes I
wanted to include.

I made a plugin for [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) which
does a similar thing, see
[JSDependencyInjector.py](https://github.com/domtronn/jsdependencyinjector)
for a better example of what I mean.
